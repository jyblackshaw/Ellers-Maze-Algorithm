The Eller's Maze Algorithm is a procedural maze generation method that operates continuously, constructing the maze row by row as its primary approach. The Eller's Maze Algorithm is renowned for its intricate yet speedy maze generation capabilities and its ability to construct mazes of infinite size in linear time. This remarkable approach builds the maze row by row using sets to track connected columns, ensuring perfect mazes each time. In the visual above, I am iterating the maze on itself, altering its texture with each pass. If you're still wrapping your head around it, I've created a comprehensive, 3 part, youtube tutorial series to walk you through the steps of its implementation within Unity.
