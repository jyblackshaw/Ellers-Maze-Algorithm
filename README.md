The Eller's Maze Algorithm is a procedural maze generation method that operates continuously, constructing the maze row by row as its primary approach. In the demonstration above, I am iterating through the maze, altering its texture with each pass. I have also created a comprehensive 3 part tutorial series that provides a step-by-step breakdown of how the algorithm functions and actual implementation of it within Unity.
